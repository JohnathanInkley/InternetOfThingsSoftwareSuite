Figure out why can't remove sites from user! Think done
- logic: if you were designing a ts database, you would probably like to be able to add different readings for the same time
        sequentially. For example, you may have multiple sensors and they add their readings after each other.
        Thus if a user has site1: x and site2: y, when you get the entry out and remove say y, you're left with site1: x
         This means when you add user to database again, you're not overriding site2: y, it's as if you're adding a different reading
         Thus I now add a null whenever I delete an entry. This ensures that site2 is set to null and so is indeed overwritten
TEST THIS CHANGE WORKS!

Also figure out why graph appears off screen - try not using d3?

Also, change inputs to be material too?

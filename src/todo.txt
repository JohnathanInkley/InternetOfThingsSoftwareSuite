So things to do for API. Have established server and client.
Need 1) Authentication for access to resources. Currently
2) Once authentication achieved, design api for the following:
//    a) Get site names user has access to
    b) Get data from specific site that appears in access list (see 2 below)
//    c) If admin client user, get access to all sites and decide which users can view what

2)
api/data/getLabels
{
    'site' : "site1"
}

api/data/get

{
    "site" : "site1",
    "dataLabel" : "temperature",
    "timeStart" : "dfgd",
    "timeEnd" : "sdsd"
}

3) Wire together

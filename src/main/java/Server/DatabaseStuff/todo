1) Move parser on to client side (in database manager maybe)
2) Check if we can get checksum from cc2650 or do we need clever parser
3) Start thinking about browser DB interaction
    - server written
    - data processing unit linked in somehow
    - Look for standard methods of getting data from server
    - look typescript
    - d3
    - google maps api for heat map?

Start on client side server and browser and set up simple interface for data processing
